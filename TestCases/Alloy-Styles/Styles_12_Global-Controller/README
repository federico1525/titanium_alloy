README

This sample checks the correct usage of the global 'app.tss' style and a '<controllername>.tss' style sheet.

Style sheets are merged and applied to the index.xml window. 

Controller style has the precedence over the app.tss - precedences are also respected.
The ".classname" style defined in index.xml style has precedence over ".classname" style and "ObjectName" styles defined in global app.tss
